# Getting Started with Training the Machine Learning Model


## How to Train the Model

Open the file Mongo_data.pynb. 
You can train the model by simply running the file. 

## How to Change the Number of Days Ahead Predicted

Head to the section:
### `OUTPUT PREDICTIONS TO JSON FILE`
In the second code block, change the `weekday_idx` to the desired number of days. 
**DISCLAIMER: Predicting too far ahead will result in slightly innacurate data.**


## Unrequired Code  
Feel free to comment out the section:
### `Data Exploration` 
as this was simply used to visualize the data and is not required in the training of the model, doing so will increase the training speed.
